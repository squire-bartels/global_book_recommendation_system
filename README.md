## **Dataset Overview**

### **Source**
The system leverages the **Goodreads 10M Dataset**, which includes:
- Titles, authors, and genres.
- Ratings and user reviews.
- Metadata such as publication year and ISBN.

### **Data Preparation**
- Data cleaning: Handles missing values and inconsistencies.
- Feature extraction: Extracts relevant features for recommendation algorithms.
- Transformation: Formats data for compatibility with machine learning models.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **1. Data Collection**
- Load and preprocess the Goodreads dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- Handle missing or null values.
- Normalize and encode data for machine learning models.
- Extract features like book genres, ratings, and user metadata.

### **3. Recommendation Models**
- **Collaborative Filtering:** 
  - Suggests books by analyzing user-item interactions and finding similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering:**
  - Recommends books with similar metadata (e.g., genre, author) to what the user has liked.
- **Hybrid Models:** 
  - Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for better accuracy.

### **4. Web Application Development**
- Build an interactive interface using **Streamlit**.
- Create user input forms for searching books and viewing recommendations.

### **5. Testing and Validation**
- Test recommendation algorithms with simulated user data.
- Validate the system with various metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and Precision-Recall.

### **6. Deployment**
- Host the application on platforms like **Streamlit Cloud** for public access.
